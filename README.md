# WPYLIB

Version 0.01

Date: 2017-04-27

This is a general-purpose Python toolbox for computational research.
The original goal of this library was to provide Python programmers
with basic, reusable building blocks to increase their productivity.
Since this toolbox originated from an academic research environment,
we did not strive to make everything polished and as general-purpose
as it could be.
Rather, we strive for clarity (to make scripts easier to understand)
so that research tools would remain usable for a long period of time.

Here is an incomplete list of the tools contained in `wpylib`:

* string and regular expression tools

* datetime handling (very experimental)

* mathematical tools: linear algebra, spline, x-y function fitting,
  basic statistics, stochastic fitting

* I/O tools, including support for Fortran binary format,
  HDF5 format, convenient text input/output.

* helpers for interactive Python sessions (e.g. ipython)

* helper for data transfer between remote hosts

* database tools

* python-specific syntactic sugar, including convenient parameter
  passing

This library was a byproduct of my research activity at
the College of William and Mary,
funded in part by the National Science Foundation,
Department of Energy, and Office of Naval Research.

WP would like to thank Dr. Henry Krakauer and Dr. Shiwei Zhang at the
College of William and Mary for allowing me to release this library to
the public.

This tool is released with a liberal software license (Apache 2.0) in
order to allow other researchers to pick and reuse the tools that I
have made for their own use.
Contributions back to the toolbox are welcome and strongly encouraged.
